# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CREDITS

**MENTIONING ALL THOSE WHO WERE BEHIND THIS COURSE** 


This course has been an extraordinary intellectual journey, made possible through the visionary collaboration of **IIIT-Bangalore, VSD-IAT, and Samsung Semiconductor Research India**. It has provided students from grades 6 to 12 with a remarkable opportunity to explore the dynamic world of semiconductors. The initiative not only cultivates awareness but also fosters India's ambition of emerging as a global leader in this field. I firmly believe that this program plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of semiconductor education.
